# Comparative Analysis of Advanced Machine Learning Models for Real Estate Price Prediction

This repository contains the project `Comparative Analysis of Advanced Machine Learning Models for Real Estate Price Prediction on the H4M Dataset`. The goal of this project is to utilize various advanced machine learning models to predict real estate prices accurately, based on the H4M dataset.

## Dataset Overview

- **File Name**: `H4M_dataset.csv`
- **Description**: This dataset includes various attributes of houses which serve as predictors for estimating house prices.

## Project Code

- **File Name**: `project_code.ipynb`
- **Description**: This Jupyter Notebook includes implementations of seven different machine learning models:
  1. Linear Regression
  2. XGBoost Regressor
  3. AdaBoost Regressor
  4. CatBoost Regressor
  5. Random Forest Regressor
  6. K-Nearest Neighbors Regressor
  7. Neural Network Regressor (MLP)

Feature importance visualizations are provided for all models, alongside tracking and visualization of model performance.

## Execution Steps

To run this project, follow these steps:

1. **Google Colab Setup**:
   - Navigate to [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).
   - Use the "Upload" option to upload the `project_code.ipynb` notebook.
   
2. **Dataset Upload**:
   - Use the file pane on the left in Google Colab to upload `H4M_dataset.csv`.

3. **Running the Notebook**:
   - Ensure both the notebook and the dataset are uploaded.
   - Select "Run All" from the "Runtime" menu to execute all cells in the notebook.

4. **Review Results**:
   - Once all cells have been executed, review the results, plots, and performance metrics displayed in the notebook.

**Note**: Ensure you have an active internet connection when using Google Colab, as some cells might require downloading packages or dependencies.
